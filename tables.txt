Table 3-2: Ability Score Value Descriptions
ABILITY SCORE|MODIFIER|DESCRIPTION (EFFECT ON CHARACTER AND GAME PLAY)
1|-5|Incapacitated
2-3|-4|Disabled (or infant). A character with this Ability Score is noticeably damaged, whether at birth or from injury. He or she may be the object of scorn and derision, disinherited, or hidden away. Conversely, such a character’s achievements in other areas may be all the more well-regarded. Still, hardly a day will pass in which this very low Ability Score will not seriously inconvenience the character and hamper his or her progress.
4-5|-3|Deficient (or child). Players should expect low Ability Scores at this level to affect their characters regularly in play, and other characters will defi nitely notice the deficiency when interacting with them. There may be “talk” in social circles about the problem. However, this value may be appropriate for a young child.
Example — Constitution: Without horse or palanquin, Kardaine’s aging father had no hope of reaching the keep’s walls before curfew fell. Already he leaned heavily on his walking staff , and his pace had slowed to crawl since he’d fallen behind the caravan the day before.
6-7|-2|Notably weak (or youth). Abilities in this range will affect Skills based on them in an obvious way and may be noticed by other characters, especially in contrast to more able peers. However, this value may be appropriate for an older child.
Example — Wisdom: Ser Ran felt sorry for his companion, Mirian, for she was unlikely to be promoted to a captaincy. Though she was of noble birth, an able swordswoman, and a charismatic leader, her ill-considered comments had harmed the morale of her company on more than one occasion.
8-9|-1|Below average (or young adult). Training in specific skills may overcome this slightly lower Ability Score. This value is not uncommon for a character who is nearly a grown man or woman.
Example — Charisma: Ser Sebastian hoped Eileen would be impressed with his skill in the hunt, since he knew her other suitors would be more handsome and better schooled in the social graces than he.
10-11|0|Adult human average. The character is not noted for this Ability, nor is he or she notably defi cient in it.
Example — Intelligence: As a child, Laurel had longed to sit at the table with the young apprentice maesters, but while their talk filled her imaginationwith pictures of far lands and strange philosophies, she could not fathom the discipline it would take to converse with them as equals.
12-13|+1|Above average. The character’s Ability enhances his or her related Skills, but is not seen as unusual.
Example — Strength: The party knew that with Laurel’s help, the firewood could be quickly gathered and they could settle into camp before nightfall.
14-15|+2|Notable. The Ability has a moderate character or game effect.
Example — Dexterity: Though in the end the tourney was taken by Lord Fossaway’s experience, Ser Ran Tyrell’s horsemanship and agility saved him from any serious injury, and several admirers came away from the joust wondering at the background and training of the quick young knight.
16-17|+3|Highly capable. Even a young character with an Ability score at this level will have been noticed by his or her peers and perhaps by wider society. Other characters may expect that he or she has training in Skills guided by this Ability, and it may be difficult for the character to avoid being stereotyped. This Ability will be apparent in almost any activity the character undertakes.
Example — Charisma: Though he would have preferred to be complimented for his position and achievements, septon Kardaine was still remembered in his home village as the beautiful and charming young novice, and, to his embarrassment, whenever he visited the Sept the old women there couldn’t help showing him off and remarking how they’d known what a handsome man he’d become.
18-19|+4|Outstanding (best among normal folk). The character cannot help but be known to excel in this regard.
Example — Intelligence: “Too clever by half, that Heldan,” growled old Griz. “How was I to know he had that paper decoded afore he ever talked to me? Caught out the lie Morro’d put me up to straight away, like. Guard your tongue around that one, I say. Safest not to give him nothin’.”
20-21|+5|Extraordinary (best in the region). This fantastic Ability is practically impossible to hide. Muscled physique, quickness, stamina, insight, serenity, or beauty might give it away in a chance meeting, and a character with such a statistic will have a reputation for his or her potential in this area, if not yet for any specific Skill. A person such as this would come to the attention of the best tutors, the highest noble sponsors, and, perhaps, the most jealous rivals.
Example — Constitution: Though many years had passed, Jenna was still the talk around the Twins when other news got stale. It had been a mystery how she survived the end of winter with her kinfolk dead around her, poor lass, but no one dared pity her now, or risk the wrath of her six-foot frame.
22-23|+6|Best in the kingdom (maximum human potential).
Example — Strength: After his performance in the joust, the fame of the anonymous hedge knight and his emblem, a burning rook, spread quickly through the lists. Several younger knights joked nervously about drinking hard enough tonight to have to withdraw on the morrow. “He’d withstand the Mountain that Rides,” one said, exaggerating, but no one laughed.
24-25|+7|Beyond human achievement
26+|+8 (and up)|Legendary ability

* Children can be very good at deceiving adults when the adults are distracted, inattentive, or engrossed in other matters. Like servants and pets, children are quite often treated as if they are invisible. If an adult has reason to suspect a child of mischief or has full attention upon the child, these Bluff bonuses should not be counted.
Note: Characters who are age 11 or younger are not very physically mature. They move about two-thirds as fast as adults (base speed 20 feet per round), and cannot use large shields, or two-handed weapons, though they may wield one-handed weapons with both hands (GMs might allow exceptions to characters with a particularly high Strength).

Table 8-4: Prayer Results
CHECK RESULT|INTERVENTION EFFECT
1-15|No discernible result
16-20|Indirect Intervention: the praying character gains an insight or hunch into what might lie at the root of their problems or how they might be solved (the GM can offer veiled hints as to the best course of action).
21-25|Minor Intervention: seemingly random circumstances aid the character for a brief but crucial period. Abrupt changes in the weather might effect the outcome of a battle, chance meetings with allies might provide rescue or needed information, perhaps even a reroll of one critical check, similar to effects of Fortune's
Favour. Seemingly miraculous recovery from injury or sickness also fall under this category.
26+|Direct Intervention: the character actually hears the voice of one of the Seven or is witness to events so extraordinary that their value as portents in unmistakable. As long as the praying character keeps to the course the Seven direct them upon, they receive the benefits of Minor Intervention at critical junctures (at the GM's discretion).

Table: Attack (Mounted) vs. Ready
MOUNTED ATTACKER ON FOOT|DEFENDER RESULT
Armed with long sword, charge Ready with long sword|Defender attacks first, when attacker comes into range; then the attacker attacks

Armed with long sword, ride-by attack Ready with longspear|Defender attacks first, when attacker comes into range; attacker attacks, then rides by
Armed with lance, ride-by attack Ready with longspear|Defender attacks first, when attacker comes into range; attacker attacks, then rides by
EndTable
If a character attacks an opponent who has held a ready action (page 235), one of several outcomes is possible. Normally, the longer weapon strikes first. If the weapons are of the same size, the readied weapon strikes fi rst. Thus a defender with a readied weapon acts first, as soon as the attacker comes into range, unless the attacker has a longer weapon.
This rules also applies if the attacker is charging, or is mounted. Normally, the attacker with a longer weapon would roll to attack first; if the defender survives the charge, he or she gets a single retaliatory strike even if the attacker is making a ride-by attack (a type of charge). If the defender has a reach weapon, though, the attacker's advantage is negated.
Note: GMs who want to provide more precise combat options should note the length of reach weapons, where provided. For example, a tourney lance is 12 feet long, while a war lance is 10 feet length - and thus the tourney lance should strike first.

Table 5-1: Social Status
RANK|DESCRIPTION
-1|OUTCAST (see Outcast Defect, page 202)
|The character is an outcast from society. He or she may be a criminal, exile, wildling, outlaw, or slave, and has no social standing. The character has no Influence Points, no Wealth (Rank -1, see the Poor Defect, page 202), and no assets except what he or she has scavenged or been given.
0|SMALLFOLK / APPRENTICE / NOVICE / SELLSWORD / SQUIRE / HEDGE KNIGHT
|The character has no particular standing, and is essentially a member of the smallfolk. This may be due to age or lack of experience. The character must work hard, and some days are still a struggle, but the character also experiences small joys. The character has access to the minimum equipment needed for his or her profession. The character has no Base Influence Points nor Wealth.
|NOTE: A hedge knight or respected member of the smallfolk (like a skilled blacksmith) tends to be of this Rank, but either has the Raised Status Feat (Influence over the local village, etc.), the Command Feat, or the Wealth Feat.
1|SWORN SWORD / HOUSEHOLD SERVANT / LESSER MERCHANT / ACOLYTE MAESTER
|The character is connected to a house or organisation, and can rely on it for minor support and favours, and is expected to serve or be called on in return. The character has access to at least the minimum equipment needed for his or her profession, and likely room and board. He or she may be able to acquire more valuable goods for pressing business. The character has +5 Base Influence Points over a house or organisation (possibly gained by the Raised Status Feat), and Wealth Rank 1.
2|HOUSE RETAINER / LANDED KNIGHT / MERCHANT / MAESTER
|The character has achieved powerful connections to a house or organisation, and in return acquires greater status and wealth. The character’s family may have been loyal for more than a generation. The character can call upon his or her organisation to provide whatever equipment is needed within reason, and can even request the service of household servants (characters with Rank 1 in the same organisation or less, such as septas, hunters, or men-at-arms) on occasion. In return, the character is expected to support the organisation and may be called on as needed. The character has +10 Base Influence Points over a house or organisation, and Wealth Rank 2. The character is ECL +1.
3|MEMBER OF A MINOR HOUSE / GREATER LANDED KNIGHT / GREATER MERCHANT
|The smallest of lords commands respect due to his blood, but this may be matched or even surpassed by the greatest landed knights and merchants. Whether baseborn or lowest of the highborn, these individuals have lands and wealth attached to their name, and this passes through the generations. The character likely commands small properties and has signifi cant wealth. A greater landed knight may have more sworn swords, and a greater merchant more ships, but a noble will technically be ranked above them. The character can call for significant aid from the organisation regularly, but is expected to defend and support it at all times. The character has +15 Base Influence Points over a house or organisation, and Wealth Rank 3. The character is ECL +2.
4|MEMBER OF A GREAT HOUSE / ARCHMAESTER / BROTHER OF THE KINGSGUARD
|The character has major status in Westeros. The character automatically outstrips anyone who was not born or raised into nobility, no matter their wealth or armies. The character likely commands moderate properties and has substantial wealth. The character can call for signifi cant aid from his or her bannermen, but has many obligations to the house, and occasionally to his or her bannermen, as well. The character has +20 Base Influence Points over a house or organisation, and Wealth Rank 4. The character is ECL +3.
5|MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY
|The character is one of the most powerful nobles in Westeros, an immediate member of the royal family (prince, princess, etc.). The character has tremendous resources, in the form of property, men, wealth, etc., and can likely borrow even more from allies for a short time. The character can call for substantial aid from his or her bannermen, but the obligation to the house is nearly total. The character has +25 Base Infl uence Points over the royal house (the kingdom), and Wealth Rank 5. The character is ECL +4.
(6)|KING (OR RULING QUEEN)
|The character is the most powerful noble in Westeros, the king (or ruling queen) of the Seven Kingdoms. The king or queen has vast powers and resources, and can theoretically command any and every noble across the lands. In reality, the king or queen has as many duties and obligations as powers, and may have to court the great lords and ladies in order to get what he or she wants. The character is Social Status Rank 5, with the Heir Feat and the Head of House Feat, for a Base Infl uence over the Kingdom of +30, and Wealth Rank 6.

Note: * A Maester normally acquires his first link at 2nd Level. When this occurs, he becomes known as an acolyte, with Social Status Rank 1 and has 5 Influence Points for the Citadel.
** A Maester normally says his vows somewhere between 3rd and 5th Level. When he does this, he forsakes his name. As an initiate, however, he has Social Status Rank 2, and gains 5 more Influence Points (normally spent on the house to which he is assigned).

Table 11-1: Wealth Ranks
RANK|DESCRIPTIVE VALUE
-1 |The character is completely destitute. He or she has no means, no incomes, no resources. The character might not even own clothes or food, if he or she is a slave or criminal, and must either steal, be given those things, or do without.
0 |The character is poor, but not completely without means. The character has a roof over his or her head and meals are rarely a worry, although they consist of simple fare.
|The character owns a few things, and has access to whatever equipment is needed to fulfi l his or her job, but may not own it. He or she may be willing to scrimp and save in order to afford a rare luxury. The character can support a small family, though sacrifices will have to be made.
1 |The character is stable. He or she owns a small homestead or is in service to a lord who provides room and board. The character owns or has regular access to any equipment needed for his or her profession. The character may have a few fancy outfi ts, a family heirloom of reasonable worth, or certain specialised tools. Occasional luxuries are purchased without worry, and the character can support a medium-sized family without concern. If a merchant or artisan, the character may employ a couple of apprentices who serve for room and board.
2 |The character is well off. He or she has claim to certain lands or has established a profi table business. The character has access to whatever he or she needs on a daily basis, although large expenditures (a bejewelled suit of armour, a longship, a gala ball, entertaining the king, etc.) should be rare. The character may have stockpiled resources up over the years, and is thus able to weather small crises or unexpected turns in fortune. A merchant might have numerous assistants and warehouses in several ports. A knight could have a small holdfast and garrison of men-at-arms. The character could not long withstand a siege (either military or economic), but can make reasonable aggressive or defensive manoeuvres (again, military or economic).
3| The character is wealthy. He or she has extensive holdings, either rich lands or profitable businesses. The character may be more powerful than some small lords in terms of resources and the ability to marshal soldiers. The character should have reasonable stockpiles of supplies, and is able to weather major crises or extended downturns in fortune. A merchant might have a fleet of ships, while a knight could control a major castle and surrounding lands. These properties may employ dozens or even hundreds of men and women, who are reasonably loyal to the character. The character could survive a siege although at great cost. Similarly, the character could easily marshal troops for skirmishes or raids, or support a greater lord’s army; the character cannot truly wage a long war against an equal or greater opponent without tremendous sacrifice.
4| The character is very wealthy. He or she has either multiple large properties, or holds a key territory. The character may be a staunch supporter and key resource to a great house, and has tremendous sway in the region due to economic control. The character is able to weather extended crises or disastrous changes in fortune, and survive anything less than a concentrated attack. The character likely has hundreds or even thousands of vassals. The character could survive an extended siege. The character can wage war against a weaker foe without signifi cantly diminishing his or her own forces, and can commit against an equal or even superior force, although at great risk.
5| The character is tremendously wealthy. He or she controls an enormous territory, with many holdings and assets. The character is a major force in any area to which he or she chooses to commit himself (militarily, economically, politically, etc.). The character can survive anything but the harshest winters or greatest disasters. The character has thousands or tens of thousands of sworn men and women, and diversified resources. He or she could survive a siege almost indefinitely and can call the swords for an extended war. The character can supply a massive army, or navy, or possibly both, and can normally survive even a powerful loss as long as there is some way out.
6 |The character is fabulously wealthy — one of the richest few anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms or the lands to the east. He or she controls an enormous territory and additionally holds plum resources (mines, trade routes, rare vineyards, etc.). The character’s holdings are similar to those of the previous Rank, but the character may also lend tremendous sums to other houses or organisations — equipping armies, financing campaigns, hosting royalty, etc. These tend to have the highest returns in political favours. The character’s army may not be bigger than another lord’s, but it will likely be better equipped and lords and generals will be more opulently furnished. The character’s resources are very difficult to diminish or impact in any serious way.
EndTable
Note: If a character makes a signifi cant purchase (relevant to his or her Wealth Rank) it may temporarily reduce the character’s Wealth Rank. It is suggested that Wealth rarely be lowered by more than 1 Rank, and this penalty should last only until an appropriate amount of time has elapsed (normally between one session and until the end of a significant story
arc). Similarly, if the character discovers a windfall (wins a major tourney, ransoms a wealthy lord, etc.) the character’s Wealth Rank may temporarily rise by 1 Rank.
